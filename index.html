      <p>My name is Taylor Paddock and I am constantly growing my skills to become a developer. I currently work for glassybaby and over the past 7 years I have moved 
          into many different positions and departments in order to gain knowledge of every part of the business. I started as a quality control associate and worked my way
          up into a customer service manager and then project coordinator for marketing. Next, I became a project manager of operations and now I have gotten the opportunity to be the e-commerce web manager
          due to my self starter work ethic and do it yourself attitude.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am now taking courses through University of Washington to further my knowlege of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so I can become the best devolper I possibly can be.</p>
