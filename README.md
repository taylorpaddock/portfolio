Create a website portfolio to further my career as a web developer. 

I learned how to properly use flexbox and pseudo classes in order to make my website dynamic. I figured out how to use media querys to make my website responsive as the screen gets smaller.

## Installation

Website can be accessed through my Gitlab profile via index.html.

## Usage

Website can be viewed on desktop and meets all standards for accessibility.
